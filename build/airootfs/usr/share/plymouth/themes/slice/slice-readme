Slice: A Plymouth startup and shutdown animated splash theme (version 1.0).
 
The theme performs smoothly as described on an i7 3630 cpu and Intel HD 4000 hardware.

Installation:

Here I confine myself to actions that are executed in a terminal. If your file manager presents
a 'Run in Terminal' option when double-clicking an executable text file, then you can use that approach.

1. Download and extract the Slice Plymouth theme. This will create a 'slice' subfolder.
2. In a terminal, navigate into the slice folder and execute:
      ./install-slice [ENTER]

   Framebuffer=y is asserted, and the plymouth-x11 package is installed. The plymouth-x11 package provides
   for testing the theme without re-booting.

3. At the prompt, enter the number for the slice theme.

   A 10-second test preview of your new startup and shutdown theme will be displayed.

   You can repeat the 10 second test with:
      ./test-plymouth [ENTER]
   NOTE: The animation rate during this test tends to be faster than in an actual shutdown or restart.


Post-installation:

Edit slice.script

You can:
1. adjust the slice animation rate at line 37.
2. adjust the size of the animation at line 38.
3. choose cycled colors or a fixed color at line 39.  A solid color comes from 'glow.png'. Modify it to suit.
4. set the color cycle rate at line 40. 
5. enable or disable the progress bar at line 42, and tweak it at line 43.

In addition, you may add your own compositions to the theme. Using Gimp, edit the file, 'user_overlay.png', 
which is completely transparent to begin with. Add text in the color, size, and font of your choice. 
You are not limited to text, nor do you have to use text. You can totally personalize this overlay. The 
image will be stretched to suit your display resolution. Set the user_overlay_style of your choice at line 48.

Most people who opt for this feature would probably use it to display hardware specifications of the computer. 
But displaying textures, short quotations, aphorisms, poems, and mottos would be other possible uses for it. 


You can leave the editor open while you are making and testing your modifications. 
Just save the file, and in the terminal, execute:
  ./update-slice [ENTER]
You can repeat the 'modify, save, update-slice' sequence as often as you like. When finished close the editor.
NOTE: The animation rate during these tests tends to be faster than in an actual shutdown or restart, and the
test's appearance at 4x3 aspect does not accurately reflect an actual shutdown and restart.

If you attempt any modifications, and those modifications inadvertently result in a black startup screen, 
the fastest way to recover is to re-extract the download, and then re-install it.


If you have not made any changes to the files in the slice folder, you can repeat the 10 second test with:
  ./test-plymouth [ENTER]
  
  
If the shutdown graphic does not suit you, substitute or modify 'shutdown.png'.


If you are ultimately displeased with the theme or it just will not perform well on your hardware, you can
restore the original Plymouth splash as follows.
Navigate in a terminal to the slice folder and execute:
  ./update-plymouth [ENTER]
When requested, enter the number of the ubuntu-logo theme or any other theme that you were using previously.
